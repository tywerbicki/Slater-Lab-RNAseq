# Welcome to the official documentation of the Slater Lab RNAseq tool.

The Slater Lab RNAseq tool is used for processing raw RNAseq data right from the sequencing machine. Its purpose is to automate many of the preprocessing steps required by an RNAseq workflow, as well as exploit their embarrassingly parallel nature to drastically decrease their cumulative execution time. Below you will find the resources necessary to become acquainted with the tool and incorporate it into your future workflows:

1. Environment necessities.
2. Setting user-defined parameters.
3. What to expect as output from the tool.
4. Additional tips.

This documentation and all aspects of the tool are authored by *Ty Werbicki*. Please email Ty at `ty.werbicki@ucalgary.ca` with any questions, concerns, or suggestions to improve the functionality of the tool.


## 1) Environment necessities.

The following is a list of necessary requirements that must be satisfied for you to be able to utilize the tool effectively:

1. A member of the `slater_lab` group on ARC. This will grant you permission to access the lab's shared workspace.

## 2) Setting user-defined parameters.


## 3) Setting user-defined parameters.



## 4) Setting user-defined parameters.
